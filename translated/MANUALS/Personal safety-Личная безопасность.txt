I think everyone here works through a virtual machine. Therefore, I advise you to install a virtual machine on a encrypted volume using VeraCrypt.
1 download Veracrypt
2 you will need to allocate space on your disk for a file / or pin the entire disk at once
An important rule is that you will have to install the virtual machine again, because unfortunately, when encrypting your old working virtual machine, an insurmountable error will occur in the code and it will no longer start. This is not a big problem, because you can get all your files from the image of your old virtual machine through 7 ZIP.

Do not forget to save the passes for entering this chat or jabber Tokyo, because if you lose it, then no one will help you to return.

(if anyone can find a way without installing a new OS, please write down I will fix it)
