I will tell you another moment about ad_users , there is a lot of information about employees, you can find techies, engineers, etc. there. We usually need ad_users when we want to find the admin's car, because on the admin's cars we can find floggings from the antivirus console, from cloud backups, and so on. Now I will throw off the USER HUNTER manual, with the help of it, we find these cars. We also need ad_users to take the SID from there, for the golden ticket, but more on that later
1. making a list of targets
1.1 Open ad_users , we are looking for someone who is potentially interesting to us: admin / engineer / inform technologists / IT
we take the logins of the accounts from sAMAccountName
1.2 We take the list of domain admins
1.3 we put it in a file list.txt first and second

2. Aploadim power view.
2.1 powershell-import _/home/user/soft/powerview/view.ps1_
2.1 --comment: importing power view from /home/user/soft/powerview/view. ps1

2.3 Turning on the hunting
2.3.1
psinject 1884 x64 Invoke-UserHunter -Threads 20 -UserFile C:\ProgramData\list.txt >> C:\ProgramData\out.txt

instead of 1884-PID of the process where we have enough rights to make an injection.
x64-or x86-bitness of the process. see the tasklist
In c \ programdata\sheet.tht should be the list that we made in item #1.
after 5-10-20 minutes, watch the cut in the out. tht. As soon as he finishes, he immediately replenishes it at once. that is, if the file is 0byte, it means that it works or AB has been deleted(if ab has been deleted, you will see it in kobe)
