raising the rights (default)
if we see that the bot came with a blue moniker, the first thing we check is the rights of our user on the wheelbarrow ( shell whoami /groups )
if we see at the very top that we have admin rights ( BUILTIN\Administrators ) then we boldly click the pcm on the bot-acess-elevate
next:
svc-exe ( start a new session on the bot not from the process but from the services, the session will come from the system with a red manik )
uac-token-dubl ( start the session from the current user, but with a red manik )
